# Project Name

This project uses NS3 version 3.36 to simulate network behavior with a focus on enhancing understanding and performance of network protocols under specific conditions. NS3 is a discrete-event network simulator, which is widely used in research and education.

## NS3 Version

This project is developed with [NS3 version 3.36](https://www.nsnam.org/releases/ns-3-36/). NS3 offers detailed and realistic simulations of network protocols, devices, and traffic.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have NS3 installed on your system. This project is specifically tailored for NS3 version 3.36.

## Getting Started
